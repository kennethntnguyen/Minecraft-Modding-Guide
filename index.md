After you are done downloading the mods above and don't want to install shaders then skip to [3\. Installation Guide Using MultiMC](#3.-installation-guide-using-multimc)\. However, if you want to install shaders then continue to the next section: [2\. Required Mods for Shaders](#2.-required-mods-for-shaders)\.

## 2. Required Mods for Shaders
i. [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=preview_OptiFine_1.15.2_HD_U_G1_pre16.jar)
* OptiFine is a Minecraft optimization mod\. It allows Minecraft to run faster and look better with full support for HD textures and many configuration options\. The official OptiFine description is on the Minecraft Forums\.

ii. [OptiForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optiforge/files/2947809)
* This mod can make OptiFine to be compatible with Forge\. This is an alternative before OptiFine has been officially compatible with Forge\. Although OptiFine 1\.15\.2 has been compatible with forge since G1 pre14, OptiForge will be compatible new forge version more fast, and there are an issue between OptiFine and other core mods which OptiForge fixed: [https://github.com/cpw/modlauncher/issues/37](https://github.com/cpw/modlauncher/issues/37)

I personally use the Lite version and tweak the settings to my liking\. _Note: As found by Chung, after installing this shader mobs no longer flash red when hit\._

## 3. Installation Guide Using MultiMC
* I highly recommend using MultiMC as it makes managing your Minecraft client much easier. However, if you still want to use the original launcher then use this part of the guide:<br>[4\.
